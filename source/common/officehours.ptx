      Office hours this semester are:
      <ul>

            <p>
                Mondays: 12:30pm<ndash/>1:30pm
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Tuesdays: 9:00am<ndash/>10:00am
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Wednesdays: 9:00am<ndash/>10:00am
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Thursdays: 12:30pm<ndash/>1:30pm
            </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      These 4 hours are times when I am <em>guaranteed</em> to be in my office.
    </p>
    <aside>
        <p>
            If I am unavailable during an office hour or need to re-schedule an office hour temporarily, I will post a note on my office door and send a message to the class.
        </p>

    <p>
      You do not need to set up an appointment or inform me before-hand that you're coming, unless you'd like for me to prepare something specific for our meeting. Otherwise, these are just drop-in hours for students in my courses.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to meet outside of these times, then we can set up a time that works in both of our schedules.
