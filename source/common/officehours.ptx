    <title>Office Hours</title>
    <p>
      Office hours this semester are:
      <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Mondays: 12:30pm<ndash/>2:30pm
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Thursdays: 10:30am<ndash/>12:30pm
            </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      These 4 hours are times when I am <em>guaranteed</em> to be in my office.
    </p>
    <note>
        <p>
            If I am unavailable during an office hour or need to re-schedule an office hour temporarily, I will post a note on my office door and send a message to the class.
        </p>
    </note>    
    <p>
        You do not need to set up an appointment or inform me before-hand that you're coming, unless you'd like for me to prepare something specific for our meeting. Otherwise, these are just drop-in hours for students in my courses.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to meet outside of these times, then we can set up a time that works in both of our schedules.
