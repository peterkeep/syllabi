        I am committed to creating an environment where every student feels empowered and able to learn. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please contact me. You can talk with me before or after class, visit my office hours, or email me a note with your concerns. I am happy to talk with you about some possible solutions that don't compromise the intent of the assessments in this class.

        If you have a disability or think you may have a disability, please contact the Center for Disability Services (disability.services@morainevalley.edu or 708-974-5711) to learn how to get approved for relevant accommodations. If you have already been approved for accommodations through the CDS, let me know so that we can discuss how to best implement and apply those accommodations that you are entitled to.
