    <title>Grading Policies</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This class will use a grading scheme called <q>Standards Based Grading</q> this semester. It is different from a traditional points-based grading system in several ways:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There are no points or number grades on anything. Instead, we'll focus on feedback instead of numbers.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Every assignment or assessment that is turned in for a grade will be aligned with a topic in the class that you are graded on. Your submitted work will either meet the expectations for that topic (we'll call these <q>graded standards</q>) or it will not.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You can retake things to update your grade on a standard.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
