        <title>Mathematics Department Statement on Academic Integrity</title>
        <p>
            The Department of Mathematics views upholding academic integrity as an integral part of student learning, classroom engagement, and ultimately, the production of student-generated work. The Department believes adherence to the principles stated in the MVCC Code of Academic Integrity preserves the value of assigned grades and other assessments. Instances of academic dishonesty compromise the development of problem-solving skills and other skills necessary for subsequent work in mathematics, depriving students of an authentic learning experience. Overall, we believe integrity in the mathematics classroom translates into ethical behavior beyond academia.

            There is a lot of research literature on cheating, and specifically cheating in math classes. One of the driving motivators for Academic Dishonesty in classes like this one is desperation. I have tried to introduce some grading policies that reduce stress by getting rid of whatever high-stakes exams that I can, but I still want to say: <em>if you are in a position where you feel the need to cheat in order to succeed, please talk to me first. I am happy to help!</em> We can set up a plan to retake whatever you're working on in a way that removes the need to cheat within the confines of the semester.

            Instead of a list of things that you can or cannot do on individual assessments, just make sure that you are representing your own understanding and learning honestly. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Repeated instances of Academic Dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course.
