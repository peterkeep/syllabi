        <title>Mathematics Department Statement on Academic Integrity</title>
        <p>
            The Department of Mathematics views upholding academic integrity as an integral part of student learning, classroom engagement, and ultimately, the production of student-generated work. The Department believes adherence to the principles stated in the MVCC Code of Academic Integrity preserves the value of assigned grades and other assessments. Instances of academic dishonesty compromise the development of problem-solving skills and other skills necessary for subsequent work in mathematics, depriving students of an authentic learning experience. Overall, we believe integrity in the mathematics classroom translates into ethical behavior beyond academia.

        <p>
            There is a lot of research literature on cheating, and specifically cheating in math classes. One of the driving motivators for Academic Dishonesty in classes like this one is desperation. I have tried to introduce some grading policies that reduce stress by getting rid of whatever high-stakes exams that I can, but I still want to say: <em>if you are in a position where you feel the need to cheat in order to succeed, please talk to me first. I am happy to help!</em> We can set up a plan to retake whatever you're working on in a way that removes the need to cheat within the confines of the semester.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            Instead of a list of things that you can or cannot do on individual assessments, just make sure that you are representing your own understanding and learning honestly. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Repeated instances of Academic Dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course.

        <title>A Note on Generative AI and LLMs</title>
        <p>
            The short version of this note is, simply, <q>Don't use them.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            The medium-length version of this note is that this course is one that will require you, first of all, to think deeply. The course includes calculations, computations, and other things like that, but most important is the deep thinking we'll do about the objects we learn about, the properties of them, and how they interact with each other. My stance is that there is no practical, helpful, or ethical way to use generative AI and large language models to accomplish or assist with this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I promise you that in whatever task or process you consider, these tools will do a less-than-good job and reduce your opportunity to think deeply. Mathematics is a communal activity, done by communicating with each other. While I hope that this class reflects this, I implore you to choose human communication whenever you might otherwise decide to use a tech company's forgery of dialogue.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the long version of this note, or for some ideas of productive alternatives to whatever you might think to use a generative AI tool for, please visit me in office hours or send me an email. I'd love to talk with you about ways that we can reduce our reliance on the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last, and equally important, I ask that you respect me and the work I've done by refraining from inputting my textbook, course notes, activities, practice problems, or examples into these tools for any reason.
