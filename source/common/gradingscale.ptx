    <title>Grading Scale</title>
    <p>
        Instead of focusing on a number grade for any assignments, the focus will be on feedback and growth. I will try to leave helpful comments when your answers are incorrect so that you can continue to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every grade, you will get marked categorically:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>Cannot Assess:</em> the answers might be incomplete or missing, so that I cannot assess what you know.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>Needs Work:</em> there are enough mistakes, or big enough mistakes, where it is clear that some more work is needed on this topic.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>Meets Expectations:</em> these answers are good, and while there may be some small mistakes, they are inconsequential enough that it is still clear that you understand the concepts we're testing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>Continued Learning:</em> this is the second time that you have demonstrated understanding of this topic!
                </p>

                        Continued Learning will only be a relevant grade for the Main Standards.
