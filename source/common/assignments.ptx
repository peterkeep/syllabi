        <title>Practice Problem Reflections</title>
        <p>
            Practice problems for the semester will be posted on Canvas. These problems will not be graded in the traditional sense. Instead, you will be asked to work on these problems at your own pace outside of class and report on your progress in a weekly <q>Practice Problem Reflection</q> assignment. In an effort to find a balance between flexibility and encouraging effective practice and reflection, these weekly reflections will be graded based on sufficient completion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practice Problem Reflections will be due every week on Friday (beginning during Week 2 and ending on Week 15) and will be submitted on Canvas.

        <title>Checkups</title>
        <p>
            The course will feature <q>checkups</q> throughout the semester, each testing on an approximately equal portion of the course content. Each checkup will cover specific standards, listed in the course schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the goal is that your grade at the end of the semester reflects what you've learned throughout the whole semester, the course will have replaceable checkups through retakes. The main goal with this grading scheme is to make sure that you can find out where you are misunderstanding something or where you have yet to grow in your knowledge, and then to make sure that you have the opportunity to demonstrate that you have fixed your misunderstandings or grown in your knowledge. To realize this goal, students will be offered consistent opportunities to retake previous checkups in order to update their grade as they update their understanding of the topics
        </p>
        <p>
            All students will work on the checkups independently unless otherwise noted. All checkups (and retakes) will be proctored in-person.
