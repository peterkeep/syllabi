    <title>Extra Standards</title>
    <p>
        These are topics in the course that are not as critical but still useful, interesting, and commonly included in courses that are equivalent to this one. Sometimes they are extensions of some of the topics from the Main Standards, and sometimes they are truly extra topics that can be discussed in the same way as the main standards.
