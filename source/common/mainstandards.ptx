    <title>Main Standards</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            These are the essential topics in the course that anyone can expect a student from this course (or an equivalent one at a different institution) to cover. Students should expect to be able to demonstrate their understanding of all (or almost all) of these topics by the end of the semester.

        <p>
            Demonstrating that you understand a topic in the class is great, but is not everything. A portion of your grade will be based on whether you are able to continue to demonstrate your understanding of the Main Standards throughout the semester. These Continued Learning requirements are met when you meet a Main Standard for the second time (whether that is by retaking something or demonstrating it on a different assignment)
