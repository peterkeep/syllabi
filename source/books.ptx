            We will not be using a traditional textbook in this course. This semester we will be using a free and open source calculus textbook, called <em>Discover Calculus</em>. You can find the link to the textbook website, pdf, and relevant portions of the textbook on Canvas.

            Similarly, we will not be using any specific calculators this semester. You can bring a calculator that you're comfortable with to class if you'd like, and we'll make use of free graphing tools like Desmos in class.

            Calculators with a computer algebra system are prohibited on any graded work.
