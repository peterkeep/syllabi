      <title>Grading Policies</title>
      <introduction>
          <p>
              This class will use a grading scheme called <q>Standards Based Grading</q> this semester. It is different from a traditional points-based grading system in several ways:
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          There are no points or number grades on anything. Instead, we'll focus on feedback instead of numbers.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          Every assignment or assessment that is turned in for a grade will be aligned with a topic in the class that you are graded on. Your submitted work will either meet the expectations for that topic (we'll call these <q>graded standards</q>) or it will not.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          You can retake things to update your grade on a standard.
                      </p>
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </p>
      </introduction>

          <title>Grade Composition</title>
          <p>
              Your grade will be calculated based on your progression through the different types of standards. Below is a chart denoting how many standards need to be met from each category to earn each letter grade.
          </p>
          <xi:include href="./150/gradetable.ptx" />
          <p>
              You will end the semester with the highest letter grade for which you have met the requirements in all four categories. In other words, each column represents the minimum requirements for that letter grade.
